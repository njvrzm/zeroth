A weekly series of mini projects. In the queue so far:

namesss
-------
Downloading the top 1000 baby names lists from ssa.gov for 1880-2016 and looking for interesting tidbits. One pertinent question in particular: what names were popular in the overlap of 60-90 years before I was born and 60-90 years before my wife was born but are *not* popular today?

isopluck
--------
Process the twitter firehose looking for sentences that are isograms, á là `anagramatron`_. I'm searching for long, meaningful isograms. The best I've come up with on my own is "A wickedly strong bump".
